Updates and advancements in Politics,"""New Fact: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name was ordered to be removed from the North Carolina ballot by an appeals court, delaying the start of voting.
Old Fact: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name was initially set to remain on the North Carolina ballot despite his withdrawal from the presidential race, with the Democratic-controlled State Board of Elections rejecting his request to remove his name."""
Artificial intelligence advancements,"""New Fact: Dark matter is the invisible force holding the universe together and makes up about 85% of all matter and around 27% of the universe's contents. Detecting self-interactions among dark matter could offer crucial clues about its properties. Interactions of dark matter are subtle and often confused with cosmic effects cause by AGN.
Old Fact: Dark matter makes up about 85% of all matter and around 27% of the universe's contents. Its nature and properties remained largely unknown and elusive. Its interactions, if any, were not being studied or were not known."""
Climate change impact,"""July 2019 was the hottest July on record; September 2019 was the hottest on record; January 2020 was the hottest on record"", ""July 2019 was the hottest month on record until September 2019 became the hottest; The hottest month on record until January 2020 became the hottest"""
Developments in quantum computing,"""New Fact: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm, can reduce classical optimization problems to classical decoding problems by exploiting the Fourier spectrum of the objective function. In comparison with classical optimization via simulated annealing, DQI with Belief Propagation decoding potentially achieves a better approximation ratio on certain max-XORSAT instances.
